However, instance is something that gives them a separate identity. It  is also the physical manifestation of a class that occupies memory and has data members. For example, there is class mobile, when an object is created m = mobile(), m is object. When we create different object with different specifications(mobile name, type, company) such as iphone8, s20, pixel, A13 are called as instances which actually exists."
